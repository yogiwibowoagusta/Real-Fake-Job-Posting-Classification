**Context** 

In this modern era, the Internet is the fastest way to get information and even job postings. Modern companies share their job postings in just a second, so people can see all the information and requirements for the job. However, not all of the information spread on the internet is true. Sometimes, there are some parties who just want to take personal advantage in spreading job vacancies such as taking personal information of job applicants and even harming applicants by paying some condition. 

**Problem Statement**

One of the problems on the internet, especially job vacancies, is the veracity of information. Experts study the difference in information between real and fake job postings. After knowing the properties of the information, it is now the task of the programmers to create machine learning models to classify real or fake information from the postings.

**Goals**

Based on the problem of real or false job postings, machine learning models are built to be able to predict whether job postings are real or not to help job applicants to reduce their percentage of being deceived about those postings.

**Analytic Approach**

So, what needs to be done is to analyze the dataset to be able to find the characteristics of the existing features, study the real or fake submission data.
